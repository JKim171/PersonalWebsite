                    <h5>Problem</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h4>As a member of UW Club Tennis, I noticed that our manual carpool scheduling system was inefficient and time-consuming. With over 100 members needing rides to practice, the process of matching drivers with passengers and creating optimal routes was becoming increasingly complex. This led to unnecessary detours, excessive fuel consumption, and significant time spent on administrative tasks.</h4>

                    <br>
                    <h4>I approached this challenge by implementing a two-phase optimization algorithm:</h4>
