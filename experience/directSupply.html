                    <h4>During my internship:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I designed and built end to end workflows using .NET and React</li>
                        <li>I identified, optimized, and debugged stored procedures that were used on large customer databases</li>
                        <li>I observed and worked with my team to develop best practices and concise code</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h4>I had an amazing time at this internship. It grew my coding skills by giving me hands-on experience with real-world projects, exposing me to industry best practices, and teaching me how to collaborate effectively with a cross-functional team—skills that go beyond what I learned in school classes. At the start of the internship, I worked closely with another junior developer to pick up tasks, but by the end, I was able to handle tasks independently and contribute code that was deployed to production.</h4>

                    <br>
                    <h4>My proudest moment of this internship was when we received a customer email regarding a workflow that I worked on: "Hey Guys—love it, love it, love it!! What a great update—nicely done!! Thank you!!" &lt;screenshot of the workflow I worked on&gt;. This review was very gratifying for me since it showed that all of the work I had been putting in makes an impact and affects customers positively.</h4>

                    <h4>I am excited to return to this internship and my amazing team in the summer of 2025. My team has been incredibly supportive throughout this internship and much of my growth is a direct result of their willingness to teach me. I hope to continue to grow my experience and skills through the next year of this internship.</h4>
