                    <h4>During my internship:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I designed and built end to end workflows using .NET and React</li>
                        <li>I identified, optimized, and debugged stored procedures that were used on large customer databases</li>
                        <li>I observed and worked with my team to develop best practices and concise code</li>
                        <li>I developed and deployed RESTful APIs using RTK Query to support mobile applications</li>
                        <li>I contributed to the development of native Android and iOS applications</li>
                        <li>I designed and implemented backend services to handle complex business logic</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Over these two summers, this internship has significantly enhanced my technical abilities. It provided hands-on experience with real-world projects, exposed me to industry best practices, and taught me how to collaborate effectively with a cross-functional team. My growth was particularly evident in my second summer, where I took on more complex responsibilities in mobile and backend development. What started as working closely with another junior developer evolved into independently handling full-stack features that spanned both web and mobile platforms.</h4>

                    <h4>One of the most meaningful aspects of this internship was seeing how our work directly impacted healthcare professionals in their daily operations. A particular workflow improvement we implemented received enthusiastic feedback from users, highlighting how even seemingly small technical enhancements can significantly improve someone's work experience. This experience helped me understand the vital connection between technical implementation and practical business value.</h4>
